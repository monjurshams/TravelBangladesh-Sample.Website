    <p>Bangladesh is the country of beautiful nature. But Bangladesh is a country that most people skip on their Asian backpacking trip, and it’s a real shame. Sandwiched between 2 backpacking hotspots, India and Thailand some people are forgot that there are so many beautiful places are available in Bangladesh with exotic beaches, hills, forests and other natural areas, coupled with modern facilities. In Bangladesh there are many attractions for the tourists around Dhaka city, Cox's Bazar, Chittagong, Sylhet, Sundarban etc. Today I am going to write about some beautiful destinations.</p>
